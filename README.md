# My-Guides
An app that lets users add their own tourist guides in locations around the world.
I'm making this app in react and node to learn ReactJs front end development and nodeJS backend development.
I'm using a mysql database to store users and their guides and sequelize as my ORM.

Frontend:React,
Backend:NodeJS,
Database:Mysql
ORM:Sequelize
